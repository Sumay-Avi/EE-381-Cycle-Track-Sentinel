The objective of this project is to develop an integrated system that can display the location of a cycle, as well as its running characteristics such as speed, heading and altitude above sea level on a mobile phone. Additionally, it features a buzzer, to help a person exactly locate their cycle among many others at a certain place.

This system is easy to operate. Ultimately, the project aims to both prevent robbery and display essential metrics of any cycle to all people present in our campus.

This repository consists of the report, code and applications of the system we have developed as a project in the course EE381: Electrical Engineering Lab - 2.
